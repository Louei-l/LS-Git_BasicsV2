//let y = "5" y++ 
// // so either we will have "5" + 1 which will output "51" or we will have 5 + 1 which will output 6. 
// // I am not sure whether y++ operator will coerce "5" into a number because it performs an arithmetic 
// //operation or it will coerce 1 into "1" and concatenate both strings '5' and '1' into '51'. 
// // my intuition tells me that "5" will be coerced into number 5
