/* What value does the following expression evaluate to?
   '12' < '9'

   Answer: My guess is error or undefined 

   correction: got this one wrong, it evaluates to TRUE 
   
   explanation: When you compare two strings, JavaScript performs a character-by-character comparison 
   going from left to right, so on the first comparison, it determines that '1' < '9', 
   so '12' must be less than '9'.'
