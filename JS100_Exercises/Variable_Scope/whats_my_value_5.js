let a = 1;

function myFunction(a) {
  console.log(a);
}

let b = 2;

myFunction(b); // => 2

// the a parameter is a placeholder to pass data to the function.
// console.log log the data that is passed to the function's parameter. 
// when myFunction is called it is called with variable b which has a value of 2. 
// so 2 will be passed to the function and logged.
